Formula for the number of fill-edges \( F(n) \) for a 5xn grid:

\[
F(n) = 37 + 12 \left\lfloor \frac{n-5}{2} \right\rfloor + 13 \left\lceil \frac{n-5}{2} \right\rceil
\]

This formula is based on the observed alternating pattern of adding 12 and 13 fill-edges for each column added beyond the initial 5x5 grid.
