### Base Case (For 5x8 and 5x9 Grids):

1. **Prove for Smaller Grids**: 
   - Demonstrate that in 5x8 and 5x9 grids, eliminating `madj` 4 vertices when the graph's vertex connectivity is 3 leads to a non-minimal number of edges in the triangulation.
   - Show that if a `madj` 4 vertex is eliminated, the number of edges added to form cliques is more than or equal to the case when a `madj` 3 vertex (with T or inverted T shape) is eliminated.

2. **Use of Lemma**: 
   - Utilize your lemma about vertex connectivity. Since the connectivity does not decrease, eliminating `madj` 3 vertices first helps maintain a lower connectivity level (3) for longer, allowing for more such eliminations before the graph becomes 4-connected.

### Inductive Step (For Any 5xn Grid, n > 9):

1. **Assumption for 5xk Grid**:
   - Assume that for a 5xk grid (where k < n), eliminating `madj` 3 vertices first results in a triangulation with the minimal number of edges while maintaining vertex connectivity at 3 as long as possible.

2. **Proving for 5x(k+1) Grid**:
   - Show that adding one more column (extending the grid to 5x(k+1)) does not change the overall strategy. The same reasoning about edge counts and connectivity levels applies.
   - Argue that for the 5x(k+1) grid, the early elimination of `madj` 4 vertices still leads to a higher edge count compared to prioritizing `madj` 3 vertices. Use your lemma to argue that maintaining the connectivity at 3 as long as possible is crucial for minimizing edge addition.

3. **Leveraging Connectivity Lemma**: 
   - Emphasize that by avoiding the early elimination of `madj` 4 vertices, you prevent the graph from becoming 4-connected too soon, which would restrict the potential for minimizing edges through `madj` 3 eliminations.

### Key Points in the Proof:

- **Edge Count Analysis**: At each step, compare the number of edges added when a `madj` 4 vertex is eliminated versus a `madj` 3 vertex. The goal is to show that `madj` 4 eliminations add more edges or limit future reductions in edge additions.
- **Connectivity Consideration**: Use the lemma about non-decreasing connectivity to justify why maintaining a vertex connectivity of 3 for as long as possible is beneficial for minimizing edge additions.
- **Inductive Reasoning**: The assumption made for the 5xk grid and the proof for the 5x(k+1) grid should complement each other, showing that the strategy scales with the grid size.
